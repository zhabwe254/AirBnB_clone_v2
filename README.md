Description of the project:

Building the foundational components necessary for the application's functionality. Here's a breakdown of the key elements and tasks involved

BaseModel Class: 
You'll create a parent class named BaseModel responsible for handling the initialization, serialization, and deserialization of instances. This class will serve as the blueprint for other classes in the project.

AirBnB Classes: 
Develop classes representing various entities in the AirBnB application such as User, State, City, Place, etc. These classes will inherit from the BaseModel class and encapsulate the properties and behaviors specific to each entity.

Serialization/Deserialization Flow: 
Establish a simple flow for converting instances to dictionaries, JSON strings, and files, and vice versa. This flow ensures seamless communication and storage of data within the application.

Unit Tests: 
Write comprehensive unit tests to validate the functionality of all classes and the storage engine. These tests ensure that each component behaves as expected and helps in identifying and fixing any issues early in the development process.

AirBnB Classes:
 Develop classes representing various entities in the AirBnB application such as User, State, City, Place, etc. These classes will inherit from the BaseModel class and encapsulate the properties and behaviors specific to each entity.

Abstracted Storage Engine:
 Implement the first storage engine for the project, which will handle the storage and retrieval of data. In this phase, you'll create a file storage engine to persist data to files.
